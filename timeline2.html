                        <p>Michigan Governor Rick Snyder appoints an emergency manager to cut costs.
                            At the time, Flint had a $25 million deficit due to decades-long issues with
                            the declining auto industry.</p>

                            River. The poorly-treated water corroded the lead pipes and contaminated the
                            water. Residents immediately complained about water taste, smell, and color, and
                            reported rashes and hair loss.</p>
