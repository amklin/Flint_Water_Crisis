                        <h5>Replacing Pipes</h5>
                        <p>The city can replace all the lead pipes with plastic pipes and replace the contaminated
                            water with clean water. This is the most permanent solution to the crisis as it directly
                            addresses its causes.</p>
                        <p>Experts estimate that doing this would cost at least $1.5 billion, making it the most
                            expensive solution, as well.</p>
                        <p>However, this would be worth it to ensure the safety of the thousands of citizens
                            living in Flint and still dealing with the repercussions of the crisis today.</p>

                        <h5>Water Bottles</h5>
                        <p>An immediate measure that can be taken is switching to water bottles for obtaining and consuming water,
                            ensuring its high quality.</p>
                        <p>For a time, the city of Flint itself even provided free bottled water to
                            its citizens; however, the program has since <a class="colorlink" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/us/flint-water-bottles.html">ended</a>.</p>
                        <p>Due to the sheer amount of water that would be needed for various home amenities (e.g., showers,
                            sprinklers, toilets), relying on water bottles is not sustainable in the long term.</p>
                        <p>However, this could be a good measure to take while the government is replacing pipes.</p>

                    <div class="textcontent">
                        <h5>Home Filtration</h5>
                        <p>Individuals and families can install filtration systems into their own homes.</p>
                        <p>The EPA and CDC have already conducted <a class="colorlink" href="https://archive.epa.gov/epa/newsreleases/filtered-water-deemed-safe-everyone-flint-community.html">studies</a> and determined that filtered water is safe
                            to drink. In fact, they have declared that lead levels after filtration are "too low to be tested."</p>
                        <p>Thus, this would remove heavy metals from water, allowing people to use it.</p>
                        <p>This solution would give people control over their own water and would limit costs to the city government.</p>
                        <p>However, this may end up being more expensive overall as each household would have to pay for these systems.
                            Therefore, while it may not be sustainable in the long term, this could be a temporary solution while
                            the government takes more drastic steps.</p>

                        <p>The city government could implement a variety of legislative measures to limit the damage continuing
                            to be done and to ensure a crisis like this doesn't happen again.</p>
                        <p>In particular, they should emphasize water quality in policy decisions.</p>
                        <p>To prevent its further worsening, they could outlaw the dumping of waste in waterways,
                            especially those used for human consumption.</p>
